# Atomic kernel

My latest attempt at a kernel!

## Requirements, how to build, and how to use

`TODO`

## Todo list

In no particular order, other than the order my brain thinks of them:

 - [ ] A userspace shell
 - [ ] A filesystem
 - [ ] A _verry_ rudimentary graphical system
 - [ ] A libc, to be used by all programs which need it
 - [ ] Running programs
 - [ ] Multiprocessing
