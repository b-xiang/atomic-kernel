# Contributing guidelines

## Code format

### C

I use the k&r indentation style, but with the slight modification of keeping braces on the same
line as functions as well. Try to keep to this style as much as possible. If you've written some
code in a different style, you can re-indent the all of the C files with

```
make indent
```

as long as you have the command-line utility `indent` installed on your system.

### NASM

I don't really follow any guidelines for NASM, other than the ones which the emacs assembly mode
enforce. I don't mind which style you use for this.

## Everything else

Any contributions are welcomed, of course - being an open source project.
